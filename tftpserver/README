Readme for TFTP server
Fifth exercise for Network Programming course
Author:	Jussi Laakkonen / 

Task:

To implement a TFTP server according to RFC 1350. Server supports uploading and downloading of files.
Also the support for retransmission is added.

Files:

	server.c - Server code, connection initialization, starting the file transfer.
	server.h - Header file of server.c - includes tftp operations (tftpoper.h).

	tftpoper.c - General tftp operations (upload and download) and sending/receiving of packets.
	tftpoper.h - Header file of tftpoper.c - includes generic operations (genoper.h)
	
	genoper.c - Generic operations, adding blocks to linked list, clearing list, file write/read operations.
	genoper.h - Header file of genoper.c - includes structures and encoding & decoding functions (structures.h)

	structures.c - Encoding and decoding of messages
	structures.h - Header file of structures.c, contains packet structures - includes definitions.h and errors.h

	errors.c - Error message printing, provides functions for error messages (and quit) and parameter errors. 
	errors.h - Header file of errors.c.
	
	definitions.h - The definitions file, generic includes and compile-time parameter definitions
	
	Makefile - The makefile.
	

Building the code:

	make (or make build)
	
	Builds the program with gcc using -Wall flag. Results server-executable file.


Usage:

	Define port:
		./server <port>
			<port> 	- Port used by server
			
	With default TFTP port:
		./server
			Without parameter the default TFTP server port (69) is used. This might not work on some machines
			if user does not have necessary rights to use that particular port.

	If program detects that given parameters are incorrect, usage help will be printed.


Other info:

	Packets are decoded and encoded by using cast, it might not be the best way to do it but it seems to work 
	(at least in CURL TFTP implementation it was used, I got the idea from there). I tried using similar methods
	presented at Beej's Guide to Network Programming but I didn't get it working with those ideas.

	The "packet" is sent as a void pointer (char pointer cast to void pointer) and received also in similar 
	fashion. The actual packet is got by casting received packet to structure pointer.

	Select is used to detect packets in socket and retransmission is also supported in both modes (upload and
	download).

	The timeout values can be changed by modifying values of TIMEOUT_SEC and TIMEOUT_USEC in definitions.h file.
	Default value for timeout is 1.000 seconds.

	When writing to a file the file is created (previous overwritten) and read-write-execute rights	are given to 
	the user running the program.

	Server side errors are detected but not sent to client, sending of error messages will be implemented later
	in sixth exercise. When major error is detected (cannot bind socket for instance) server terminates, with
	minor errors (file not found for instance) the server only terminates the connection (closes socket).
	
	Server can serve one client at a time. Support for multiple simultaneous clients will be added in sixth
	exercise.
	

Compile time options:

	In server.h
		PARAMS 			- amount of parameters needed for server.

	In definitions.h 
		OPCODE_RRQ		- TFTP read request code
		OPCODE_WRQ		- TFTP write request code
		OPCODE_DATA 		- TFTP data code
		OPCODE_ACK		- TFTP ack code
		OPCODE_ERROR 		- TFTP error code
		TFTP_BLOCK		- Size of TFTP datablock
		MAX_MSG			- Maximum length of message
		TIMEOUT_SEC 		- Timeout length in seconds
		TIMEOUT_USEC		- Timeout length in micro seconds
		TFTP_SERVER_PORT	- Default port of TFTP server

	I also looked at the source code of the TFTP implementation in CURL library.

		The code can be also found with codesearch.google.com with "curl tftp lang:c"
